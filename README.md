# Crop Health Monitoring
# Introduction
The use of technology in the detection and analysis process increases the accuracy and reliability of these processes. For example, the people who use the latest technology to analyze the diseases that arise unexpectedly are at a higher chance of controlling them than those that do not. In the recent occurrence of coronavirus, the world relied on the latest technology to develop preventive measures that have helped reduce the rate at which the disease is transmitted. Crop diseases are a significant threat to human existence because they are likely to lead to droughts and famines. They also cause substantial losses in cases where farming is done for commercial purposes. The use of computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) could improve the detection and fighting of diseases. Computer vision is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves using computers to understand and identify objects. It is primarily applied in testing drivers, parking, and driving of self-driven vehicles and now in medical processes to detect and analyze objects. Computer vision helps increase the accuracy of disease protection in plants, making it easy to have food security.
One of the areas that CV has helped most is the detection of the severity of the diseases. Deep learning (DL), a part of the CV, is useful and promising in determining the severity of diseases in plants and animals. It is also used to classify diseases and avoid the late detection of diseases. Plant diseases are slightly different from those that affect human beings. Many factors make diseases similar as well. However, the diseases that can be transmitted from humans to plants and vice versa are rare. The analysis of the data related to this field helps identify how the use of the latest technology can be improved. The images of leaves and other parts of the plants can be used to detect diseases in plants.
# Scope of the System 

The software will be developed for real life application. The aim of our project is to present an algorithm that automatically detect disease from image. It includes detection of diseased leaf, to measure the affected area by disease, to determine the color of the affected area. In the Application, after training of the model the inputted image will be tested. Machine Learning is doing wonders in every industry these days. The use of image processing techniques in detection and identification of leaf diseases in the earlier stages and thereby the quality of the product could be increased. Our application will give a method which will be fast and reliable. Training and testing will be done on the dataset.
